# Community Software Analysis Proposal

## Software: *preCICE*

*preCICE is a multi-physics coupling library that includes fluid-structure interactions, conjugate heat transfer and many others. This software does not include the actual physics solver, but instead leverages either open source solvers (such as OpenFoam/SU2/FeNICS) or allows for easy integration into your code. preCICE offers different coupling schemes such as explicit or implicit coupling, different mapping capabilities such as radial basis functions and different acceleration configurations such as quasi-newton schemes and dynamic aitken under-relaxation schemes depending on the strength of the coupling.*
